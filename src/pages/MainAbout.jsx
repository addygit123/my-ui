      <p className="text-white text-xl m-5">
        Our citizen science platform empowers individuals of all ages and
        backgrounds to contribute to real-world scientific research. We provide
        an engaging interface where school students, college students, and
        professionals can collaborate on projects that explore critical data
        sets, from images to complex sensor data. By connecting a diverse
        community of users with global research projects, we aim to make science
        accessible, interactive, and impactful. Our mission is to promote
        scientific literacy, foster curiosity, and contribute meaningful
        insights to various fields, such as environmental studies, space
        research, and technology
      </p>

      <h1 className="text-3xl m-5 text-white font-bold">Our Vision</h1>
      <p className="text-white text-xl m-5">
      We envision a world where anyone can contribute to science and make a tangible impact. Our platform bridges the gap between researchers and the public, providing meaningful ways to participate in cutting-edge projects. We aim to inspire the next generation of scientists and engineers while addressing the critical data bottlenecks faced by modern research. Ultimately, we seek to create a global community united by the shared goal of advancing scientific understanding.

      <h1 className="text-3xl m-5 text-white font-bold">Why Citizen Science?</h1>
      <p className="text-white text-xl m-5">
      Citizen science democratizes research, allowing anyone with curiosity to contribute to scientific discoveries. By participating, users help tackle challenges too large for individual researchers, such as processing vast amounts of data. This crowdsourced approach accelerates innovation, allowing professionals and hobbyists to collaborate on real projects. It also nurtures public interest in science, making complex topics like climate change, biodiversity, and space exploration more accessible to everyone.
